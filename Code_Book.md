t / f- time or frequency domain signals
Body or Gravity - acceleration signals
Acc/Gyro - accelerometer or gyroscope raw signals 
Jerk - acceleration and angular velocity derived in time (jerk)
Mag - calculation (using Euclidean norm) of the magnitude of the three dimensional signals 
'-XYZ' - denotes 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
